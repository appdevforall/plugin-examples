# plugin-examples

Reference plugins for [Code On The Go](https://github.com/appdevforall/CodeOnTheGo). Each folder is a fully self-contained Gradle project that builds to a `.cgp` installable plugin file.

See the official [plugin documentation](https://www.appdevforall.org/codeonthego/help/exp-plugins-top.html) for concepts, the plugin API surface, and install workflow.

## Building a plugin

Every plugin is a standalone Gradle project that shares two jars from this repo's root `libs/` folder.

```sh
cd plugins/Voice-Alerts
./gradlew assemblePlugin
```

The resulting `.cgp` file lands under the plugin's `build/plugin/` directory. Install it from inside Code On The Go via the Plugin Manager.

## Git hooks

This repo ships a `pre-push` nudge in `.githooks/` that reminds you to run the
plugin-review skill (`/plugin-review` in Claude Code) whenever you're pushing
changes to a plugin folder. Running the skill before opening a PR keeps peer
review focused on substance instead of issues the skill catches automatically
(resource leaks, missing manifest entries, missing in-IDE help).

Git honors only a single `core.hooksPath`, so the committed hook does nothing
until you enable it once after cloning:

```sh
./scripts/setup-hooks.sh   # runs: git config core.hooksPath .githooks
```

The hook is a **reminder only** — it never blocks a push, and it stays quiet
when your push doesn't touch any plugin folder.

## The `libs/` folder

Every plugin depends on two jars produced by the Code On The Go source tree:

- **`plugin-api.jar`** — the interface surface a plugin implements (`IPlugin`, `BuildStatusListener`, etc.). Used as `compileOnly` at build time; provided by the IDE at runtime.
- **`gradle-plugin.jar`** — the custom Gradle plugin (`com.itsaky.androidide.plugins.build`) that packages a compiled Android library into a `.cgp` file. Applied via `classpath` in each plugin's `settings.gradle.kts`.

Both jars live in `libs/` at the repo root; each plugin references them via `../../libs/*.jar`. This means a plugin folder is **not standalone in isolation** — copying just `plugins/Voice-Alerts/` elsewhere will break its build until you also bring `libs/` along. The expected workflow is: clone the whole repo, work inside one of the example folders.

## Refreshing `libs/`

Whenever Code On The Go changes the plugin API or the build plugin, the jars need to be rebuilt. Two ways to do that:

### GitHub Action (normal path)

Go to [Actions → **Update libs from CodeOnTheGo**](../../actions/workflows/update-libs.yml) and click **Run workflow**. It will clone Code On The Go at the branch or tag you specify (default: `stage`), build both jars, and commit them directly to the default branch.

### Locally

```sh
./scripts/update-libs.sh                          # builds from github.com/appdevforall/CodeOnTheGo@stage
./scripts/update-libs.sh --ref v1.2.0             # pin to a tag or branch
./scripts/update-libs.sh --local ../CodeOnTheGo   # use an existing local checkout instead of cloning
```

First local run clones Code On The Go into `.cache/CodeOnTheGo/` (gitignored); subsequent runs `git pull` in place. Review the diff in `libs/` and commit if you're happy with it.

## Adding a new plugin example

1. Copy `plugins/Random-XKCD/` to a new folder under `plugins/`. Name it in MixedCase with single hyphens between words (`My-Plugin`), ASCII letters and digits only. Every other name, filename, and URL is derived from this one — see [`docs/plugin-naming-standards.md`](docs/plugin-naming-standards.md).

2. Update **every** copied file that still names the template. Two values come from the folder name: the **slug** is it lowercased (`my-plugin`), and the **display name** is it with hyphens replaced by spaces (`My Plugin`).

   | File | Change |
   |---|---|
   | `settings.gradle.kts` | `rootProject.name` — Gradle's own name for the build. Nothing is derived from it; keep it in step with the slug anyway. |
   | `build.gradle.kts` | `pluginBuilder { pluginName }` → the slug; `android { namespace, applicationId }` |
   | `src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` | `plugin.id`, `plugin.name` → the display name, `plugin.main_class` |
   | `random-xkcd.html` | rename to `<slug>.html`; set `<title>` to the display name exactly, and make the `<h1>` contain it |
   | `addon.json` | `summary`, `description`, `tags`, `origin`, `license`, `author`. This text goes on the gallery card. A copied file passes every check while describing the wrong plugin, so rewrite it. |
   | `src/main/assets/icon_day.png`, `icon_night.png` | replace both; both must be present |
   | `src/main/kotlin/...` | your implementation |

3. Run the checks from the repository root before you push:

   ```sh
   uv run --directory tools/addons addons --root "$PWD" check
   ```

   `--root` must be an absolute path: `--directory` moves uv into `tools/addons`, so `--root .` would resolve there and find no plugins. This is the same check that runs on every pull request. It names the exact file and value it expects, so it is faster to run it here than to read it from a failed run.

4. Add a row to the **Examples** table above.
