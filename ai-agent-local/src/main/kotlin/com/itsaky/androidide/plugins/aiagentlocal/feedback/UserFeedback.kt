/**
 * Surfaces actionable LLM errors to the user as a Toast, from anywhere in the process.
 *
 * This backend serves every AI plugin through ai-core's router: chat, code-suggestions and
 * code-review all funnel their generation through it. When something is misconfigured (e.g. no
 * model selected), each consumer
 * would otherwise fail silently in its own way — code-suggestions in particular retries on every
 * keystroke, so the same error can arrive many times per second. This helper is the single place
 * that turns those into one visible, throttled message for the user.
 *
 * Throttling is keyed by message text: an identical message shown within [COOLDOWN_MS] is
 * suppressed, so typing doesn't stack a wall of toasts while still re-notifying later if the
 * problem persists after the user has had a chance to act.
