/**
 * A model file held open for the native loader.
 *
 * [nativePath] is a path llama.cpp can `fopen` and `mmap`. For a document picked through SAF that is
 * `/proc/self/fd/N` for the descriptor this handle owns: opening that procfs entry re-opens the
 * underlying inode with an independent file offset, so the native loader behaves exactly as it does
 * for a real path — without copying multiple gigabytes into private storage first. See ADFA-5253.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: the descriptor must stay open for as long as the model is resident. Closing it
 * invalidates the procfs entry, and the pages the loader has mapped are the only thing keeping the
 * model alive after that. [close] is therefore the unload path's job, not the load path's.
 *
 * @property nativePath the path to hand the native loader
 * @property sizeBytes the model's size, or -1 when the descriptor names no regular file
