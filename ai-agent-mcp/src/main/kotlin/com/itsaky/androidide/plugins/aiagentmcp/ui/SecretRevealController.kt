/**
 * The reveal control for this plugin's masked credential field.
 *
 * The control is the field's own [TextInputLayout] end icon rather than a loose `ImageButton`,
 * which is what gives it a real touch target wherever the field is shown. Icon, content
 * description and toggle behaviour are decided here and nowhere else, so this dialog cannot drift
 * from the other AI plugins' credential fields (ADFA-5491).
 *
 * Deliberately one copy per AI plugin: each addon is an independent Gradle build sharing only the
 * repo's `libs/` jars, so there is nowhere cheaper to put this until the host's plugin-api carries
 * it — a change to the masking logic is three edits, on purpose.
 *
 * @param box the field's own layout, whose end icon becomes the control
 * @param field the masked field
 * @param onLegibleChanged called with true while the secret stands in clear text, so the caller can
 *   flag its window secure — which window that is depends on the screen, not on this control
