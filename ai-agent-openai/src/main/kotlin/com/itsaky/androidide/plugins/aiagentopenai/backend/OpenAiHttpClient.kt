 * The HTTP transport this backend speaks: one POST that streams or does not, and one GET.
 *
 * [HttpURLConnection] rather than an SDK: plugins run in the host IDE's classloader, where
 * `okhttp3` resolves to the host's older OkHttp and an SDK bundling its own copy crashes with a
 * NoSuchMethodError. Kept apart from the backend so the backend is about generating, not sockets.
 *
 * Both entry points tag their sockets ([NetworkTags]): the host installs
 * `StrictMode.VmPolicy.detectAll()` process-wide, and an untagged socket trips
 * `detectUntaggedSockets()` from inside plugin code.
 *
 * @param connectTimeoutMs how long to wait for the connection itself
 * @param readTimeoutMs how long a generation may take to answer
