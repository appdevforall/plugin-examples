/**
 * Owns the chat sidebar: the panel that slides over the transcript with a new chat at the top, the
 * project's conversations in the middle and this chat's own actions at the bottom.
 *
 * It replaces the toolbar overflow menu and the chat-history dialog that stood behind it, so there
 * is one place the user goes for anything that is not typing a message.
 *
 * Attached in onViewCreated and detached in onDestroyView, so nothing it animates or collects
 * outlives the views it drives.
 *
 * @param binding the chat screen's views; the panel is part of that layout, laid over the chat
 *   column rather than docked beside it.
 * @param viewModel the plugin-scoped chat state, which is where the conversations live. Read as a
 *   flow, so a reply still streaming retitles its row while the user is looking at it.
 * @param scope the view lifecycle's scope, which the session collector runs in.
 * @param wireTooltip attaches this plugin's long-press help for a tag to a view. Rows are the
 *   exception: long-pressing one picks it, so their help hangs off the section header and the row's
 *   own ⋮ instead.
 * @param dialogContext an Activity-backed, plugin-themed Context for the rename and delete prompts,
 *   supplied by the fragment. A Dialog takes its window token from its Context, and the
 *   application-scoped plugin Context the panel itself is inflated with has a package name no
 *   PackageManager knows — showing a Dialog on it throws BadTokenException and takes the IDE down.
 *   Null once the fragment is detached, which is a prompt that must simply not open.
 * @param onOpenSettings opens the Agent settings screen, which the fragment owns because the same
 *   shortcut exists on error messages in the transcript.
 * @param onOpenChanged the panel started opening or closing. Every route out of it ends here —
 *   the scrim, Back, picking a chat, any footer action — so the fragment has one place to keep the
 *   Back handler and the soft keyboard in step with it rather than one per exit.
