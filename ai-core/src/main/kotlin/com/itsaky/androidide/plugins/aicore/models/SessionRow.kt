 *   caller that renders a session's name.
 * @property isUntitled whether [title] is only that fallback. Kept apart from the title itself
 *   because the rename prompt seeds its field from the row: prefilling it with the fallback would
 *   turn "this chat names itself after its first message" into a fixed name on the next OK.
 * @property date when the conversation was started, formatted.
 * @property messageCount how much is in it.
 * @property isActive whether this is the conversation the chat is currently in.
 * @property isSelecting whether the list is picking rather than browsing. Carried per row, not
 *   held beside the list: the mode changes what every row draws, and a row that compares equal to
 *   its old value is a row DiffUtil never rebinds.
 * @property isSelected whether this row is ticked; always false while [isSelecting] is false.
