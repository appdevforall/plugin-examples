/**
 * One immutable snapshot of the agent's tool set: the router, the executor built from it, and the
 * grammar derived from it.
 *
 * They are swapped together, behind a single reference, because a rebuild that replaced the router
 * without the grammar would leave a token mask that forbids every newly contributed tool — a green
 * build whose only symptom is "the model ignores the tools", visible on device alone. For the same
 * reason the prompt's tool list is built here rather than per message: grammar and prompt have to
 * describe one tool set, and they only do if one snapshot holds both.
 *
 * @property router routes a tool call to its handler.
 * @property executor runs a batch of calls against [router].
 * @property grammar the local backend's GBNF for exactly the tools [promptTools] describes.
 * @property promptTools the tool list as the prompt will see it, [PromptToolBudget] already applied.
