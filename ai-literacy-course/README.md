# ai-literacy-course

A Code On The Go plugin that bundles Learn AI Anywhere's offline
**"Introduction to AI"** course and plays it full-screen, fully offline.
Twenty-six short lesson videos plus interactive activities, the NeuroPocket
machine-learning app, and teacher resources — all on-device, no internet
required.

Open it from the side menu (**AI Literacy Course**). The first launch unpacks
the bundle once into the plugin's private storage; every launch after that is
instant.

## How it works

The course ships as a ~110 MB ZIP that is **not committed to git**. The
`downloadAssets` Gradle task fetches it from Learn AI Anywhere's Google Drive at
build time, verifies a pinned MD5, and packs it into the `.cgp`. At runtime the
plugin:

1. Extracts the bundle once into `getPluginDirectory()/course` and unpacks the
   nested activity zips ([`CourseInstaller`](src/main/kotlin/org/appdevforall/ailiteracycourse/CourseInstaller.kt)).
2. Generates a video-forward navigation `index.html` over the extracted tree
   ([`CourseShell`](src/main/kotlin/org/appdevforall/ailiteracycourse/CourseShell.kt)) — the bundle ships no web shell of its own.
3. Serves it over a virtual `https://appassets.androidplatform.net/` origin via
   `WebViewAssetLoader` and loads it in a full-screen WebView
   ([`CourseFragment`](src/main/kotlin/org/appdevforall/ailiteracycourse/fragments/CourseFragment.kt)). The https origin is what makes video byte-range
   seeking and NeuroPocket's service worker work.

`CourseFragment` handles the host requirements explicitly: **Back** exits a
fullscreen video, then steps back through course history, then closes the
screen; **rotation** restores page + scroll via `WebView.saveState`; HTML5
**fullscreen video** is routed through `WebChromeClient`.

No permissions are declared — the bundle is in the `.cgp`, extraction targets
the plugin's own data dir, and everything renders offline.

## Build

```bash
./gradlew downloadAssets      # fetches + verifies the ~110 MB course ZIP
./gradlew assemblePlugin      # -> build/plugin/ai-literacy-course.cgp (~119 MB)
```

`scripts/update-libs.sh` runs `downloadAssets` automatically before
`assemblePlugin`. Sideload the `.cgp` via **Preferences → Plugin Manager → +**.
